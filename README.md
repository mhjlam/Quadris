# Quadris

An unfinished Tetris clone.

## TODO

- Wall kick
- Score (line clears, time-based multiplier)
- Gravity  (levels)
- Title screen (play / exit / highscores)
- Improved overlay (better boxes)
- Improved graphics (better looking tetrominoes)
- Keep track of highscores
- Dynamic grid size
- Optimization (i.e. for tetromino rotation)
